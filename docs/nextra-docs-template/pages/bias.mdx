# Bias & Fairness

## Bias Mitigation Strategy

### Introduction
* **Purpose**: To describe the approach and steps taken to mitigate bias in the model.
* **Scope**: Details of bias mitigation techniques employed in the model lifecycle.

### Detected Biases
* Initial analysis showed a potential bias based on the `X` feature.
* List any others

### Bias Mitigation Techniques
* **Reweighing**: Adjusted the weights of training instances to ensure fairness in predictions.
* **Post-processing**: Used techniques to adjust the model's decisions to enhance fairness.
* **Fairness-enhanced Model Selection**: Evaluated multiple models based on their fairness metrics and not just accuracy.

## Sensitive Attributes

### Introduction
* **Purpose**: To list and explain sensitive attributes in the dataset that have potential for discriminatory outcomes.
* **Scope**: Identification and handling of sensitive attributes in the dataset.

### Identified Sensitive Attributes
* **X**: Binary feature indicating male or female for example.
* **Y**: Binary feature indicating if an applicant is married for example.
* Any other potentially sensitive attributes

### Handling Strategy
* **Data Anonymization**: 
* **Data Transformation**:
* **Other**:

## Proxy Analysis

### Introduction
* **Purpose**: To analyze and ensure no features act as proxies for sensitive attributes.
* **Scope**: Analysis of potential proxy attributes and their relationship with sensitive attributes.

### Potential Proxies Identified
* Potential Proxies List

### Analysis Results
* **Correlation Analysis**: Checked correlation between potential proxies and sensitive attributes.
* **Feature Importance**: Assessed using SHAP or feature importance scores etc..

## Cultural Alignment Documentation

### Introduction
* **Purpose**: To ensure the model's outputs and behaviors align with the cultural norms and values of its intended audience.
* **Scope**: Analysis and steps taken to align the model with cultural considerations.

### Target Audience
* **Country or Region**: Saudi Arabia/Middle East
* **Cultural Norms**: 

### Model Adjustments for Cultural Alignment
* **Localized Outputs**: Ensured the model's outputs resonate with the cultural language and idioms.
* **Feedback Mechanism**: Incorporated feedback from a culturally diverse group
